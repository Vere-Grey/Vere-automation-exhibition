## Features

🛠 Built with [React][reactjs], [XState][xstate], [Express][express], [lowdb][lowdb], [Material-UI][material-ui] and [TypeScript][typescript]
⚡️ Zero database dependencies
🚀 Full-stack [Express][express]/[React][reactjs] application with real-world features and tests
👮‍♂️ Local Authentication
🔥 Database Seeding with End-to-end Tests

## Getting Started

The Cypress Real-World App (RWA) is a full-stack Express/React application backed by a local JSON database ([lowdb]).

The app is bundled with [example data](./data/database.json) (`data/database.json`) that contains everything you need to start using the app and run tests out-of-the-box.

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> You can login to the app with any of the [example app users](./data/database.json#L2). The default password for all users is `s3cret`.
> Example users can be seen by running `yarn list:dev:users`.

### Prerequisites

This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your machine. Refer to the [.node-version](./.node-version) file for the exact version.

[Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) is also required. Once you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, execute the following to install the npm module [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) (Classic - version 1) globally.

```shell
npm install yarn@latest -g
```

If you have Node.js' experimental [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/corepack.html) feature enabled, then you should skip the step `npm install yarn@latest -g` to install Yarn Classic globally. The RWA project is locally configured for `Corepack` to use Yarn Classic (version 1).

#### Yarn Modern

**This project is not compatible with [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 2 and later).**

### Installation

To clone the repo to your local system and install dependencies, execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app
cd cypress-realworld-app
yarn
```

#### Mac users with M-series chips will need to prepend `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`.

```shell
PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true yarn install
```

### Run the app

```shell
yarn dev
```

> 🚩 **Note**
>
> The app will run on port `3000` (frontend) and `3001` (API backend) by default. Please make sure there are no other applications or services running on both ports.
> If you want to change the default ports, you can do so by modifying `PORT` and `VITE_BACKEND_PORT` variables in `.env` file.
> However, make sure the modified port numbers in `.env` are not committed into Git since the CI environments still expect the application to run on the default ports.

## Database

- The local JSON database is located in [data/database.json](./data/database.json) and is managed with [lowdb].

- The database is [reseeded](./data/database-seed.json) each time the application is started (via `yarn dev`). Database seeding is done in between each [Cypress End-to-End test](./cypress/tests).

- Updates via the React frontend are sent to the [Express][express] server and handled by a set of [database utilities](backend/database.ts)

- Generate a new database using `yarn db:seed`.

- An [empty database seed](./data/empty-seed.json) is provided along with a script (`yarn start:empty`) to view the application without data.

## 3rd Party Authentication Providers

Support for 3rd party authentication is available in the application to demonstrate the concepts on logging in with a 3rd party provider.

The app contains different entry points for each provider. There is a separate **index** file for each provider, and to use one, you must replace the current **index.tsx** file with the desired one. The following providers are supported:

- [Auth0](#auth0) (index.auth0.tsx)
- [Okta](#okta) (index.okta.tsx)
- [Amazon Cognito](#amazon-cognito) (index.cognito.tsx)
- [Google](#google) (index.google.tsx)
